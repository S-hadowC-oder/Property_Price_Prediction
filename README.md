# Predictive Model for Real Estate Prices

## Description
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting real estate prices based on various property attributes. The model leverages linear regression to analyze the dataset and provide accurate predictions. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and serialization for future use.

## Overview
This project is focused on building a predictive model for real estate prices using machine learning. The dataset contains various features related to real estate properties, and the goal is to develop a robust model that can predict property prices accurately.

## Files in the Repository
- **Real_Estate.csv**: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **Predective model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **linear_regression_model.pkl**: A serialized version of the trained linear regression model.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-predictive-model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd real-estate-predictive-model
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code step by step:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Predective model.ipynb"
   ```
4. To use the trained model, load it in Python:
   ```python
   import pickle
   with open("linear_regression_model.pkl", "rb") as file:
       model = pickle.load(file)
   ```

## Model Details
- The model is based on **Linear Regression**.
- The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
- Evaluation metrics include **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

## Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced models such as **Random Forest** or **XGBoost**.
- Perform feature engineering to improve accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web application.
